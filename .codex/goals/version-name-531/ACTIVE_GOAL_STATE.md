# Active Goal State

## Objective

修复 _version.py version_name 漂移 (5.31.0 发布名) + 星链反思: 为何审计与发布 checklist 都未发现此元数据 bug

## Authority Sources

- No explicit goal document was provided during bootstrap.

## Operating Contract

- Treat this file as the durable goal state for future agent ticks.
- Treat the authority sources above as the first context to inspect before acting.
- Read current project evidence before choosing the next action.
- Run a bounded progress segment when useful; it does not have to be one tiny step.
- Keep private evidence, credentials, local paths, and raw logs out of public commits.
- End each tick with changed files, validation, residual risk, and the next action.

## Execution Profile

- `cadence=bounded_progress_segment minimum=multi_surface_or_implementation include=coherent_artifact,targeted_validation,state_writeback spend_rule=spend_only_after_artifact_validation_writeback small_streak_threshold=2`
- Repeated small-scale follow-through should expand the next delivery batch or report a blocker before spending quota.

## Non-Goals

- Do not perform irreversible production operations without explicit approval.
- Do not publish private project evidence.
- Do not optimize for activity if no useful artifact or decision can be produced.


## User Todo / Owner Review Reading Queue

## Agent Todo

- [ ] [P1] Run `loopx check` against the project registry and record the first project-specific adapter signal or an explicit no-follow-up rationale.

## Next Action

- [P1] Run `loopx check` against the project registry and record the first project-specific adapter signal or an explicit no-follow-up rationale.

## Recent User Feedback

- Initialized by `loopx bootstrap`.

## Progress Ledger

- Created the initial goal state and registry connection.
